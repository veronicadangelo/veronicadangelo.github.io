### Transport and deformation of flexible filaments in model porous media.
#### Supervisor: María Verónica D'Angelo
#### #### Laboratory: Grupo de Medios Porosos, FIUBA and Instituto Franco-Argentino de Dinámica de Fluidos para el Medio Ambiente (IFADyFE)
The transport and entrapment of filaments in complex environments, such as porous media, occurs in a variety of systems and is important for many applications in physics, medicine and engineering. The transport of micro-organisms, the entrainment of biofilms, the propagation of plastic microfibres in soil or the use of fibres to prevent the backflow of proppant during hydraulic fracturing are just a few examples.
When filaments transported in a flow encounter obstacles, they can interact hydrodynamically with them and deform in response to viscous and elastic forces, allowing the filament to continue its journey through the flow lines or become trapped. The presence of the medium can therefore affect the transport properties of the filaments. In all these situations, the deformation and transport of the filament are determined by a complex interplay between elasticity, viscosity and interactions with obstacles.
We propose to study the influence of the filament and flow characteristics on the dynamics of its transport by viscous flow through a 3D matrix of obstacles modelling the transport of flexible bodies through a porous medium. The experiments will be carried out by systematically varying the key parameters of filament transport and deformation: length, diameter, modulus of elasticity and mean flow velocity.  The tasks to be carried out concern the experimental set-up for obtaining and processing digital images, identifying and reconstructing the shape and position of the filament as a function of time, which will enable its trajectory to be reconstructed.
These studies will make it possible to determine experimentally the relationship between the forces and the dependence of the various parameters on the deformation and transport or trapping of the filaments in the model porous medium.
