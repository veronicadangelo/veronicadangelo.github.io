The study of a bubble rising in a geometry confined between two parallel plates oriented vertically and separated by a ‘small’ distance h (Hele-Shaw cell) is of great interest because of the many potential applications. 
The main objective of this work is therefore the experimental study of the ascent of an air bubble in a Hele-Shaw cell, saturated with water, in a channel of variable geometry. The movement and deformation of isolated bubbles will be studied, with particular emphasis on those whose characteristic size is equal to or greater than the distance between the walls. 
The deformations induced by the walls should, on the one hand, cause controlled movement of the liquid in the vicinity of the bubble and, on the other hand, increase the efficiency of mass transfer compared with what is observed with straight or sufficiently distant walls.
In order to study the deformation of a bubble moving up a confined channel, we will use a 2D medium whose movable inner walls enable us to modify the geometry of the medium in which the bubbles are transported. The parts will be designed using programmes such as AutoCAD and manufactured using 3D printers. The walls of the cells will be transparent to allow observation of the profiles of the bubbles when they are illuminated by transmission and to analyse the movement of the fluid when tracers are included. 
The student will become familiar with image acquisition and processing for this type of experiment. Existing codes will have to be adapted/improved for these studies. 
Finally, the study will be extended to the 3D case, by studying the ascent of a bubble in a three-dimensional channel with obstacles inside.  The first experiments in a 3D environment will be carried out to analyse the influence of the geometry of the environment on the average speed of the bubbles and on their deformation
